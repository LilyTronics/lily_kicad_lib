## Datasheets

For parts datasheets are available in the folder `datasheets`.
The datasheets should be arranged as follows:

```
 /datasheets
   |- manufacturer
       |- part_name.pdf
```

For generic components the datasheet of the preferred manufacturer should be linked.

In KiCad set the datasheet field of the part to:

https://lilytronics.github.io/lily_kicad_lib/datasheets/manufacturer/part_name.pdf
